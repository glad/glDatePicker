Installation / Usage
--------------------

Extract the js and css folders from the archive.

Then add references to the stylesheet and javascript files in your page:

    <link href="css/default.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/glDatePicker.js"></script>


Make sure you have a textbox that you can tie the plugin to:

    <input type="text" id="date" />


Finally bind the plugin to the input textbox and set any options you want:

    $("#date").glDatePicker(
    {
        allowOld: false,
        startDate: new Date("September 5, 2011"),
        endDate: new Date("October 26, 2011"),
        onChange: function(target, newDate)
        {
            alert("You selected: " + newDate);
        }
    });
